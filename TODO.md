# DeepSplitting

- [ ] Make sure that you propose several options
    - [ ] when u_domain is not nothing, then you return the nn
    - [ ] When u_domain is nothing, you only return the value assessed at X0
> u_domain is the domain over which the samples for non local term should be drawn
> make sure that this is coherent
> maybe you want to use your mc_sample method to sample initial points as well

    - [ ] when neumann is specified, you reflect at neumann[1], neumann[2]

- [ ] make sure the x0 argument is consistent

- [ ] Try to calculate problem for Hamel, possibly modifying the sampling (uniform)
